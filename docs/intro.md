## What is Embedr?

Embedr allows any kind and size of merchants to plug and start offering financial services to the consumers without any intermediaries - be it clincs, fashion shops, clinics, universities, even municipalities.

This direct consumer to merchant relationship opens the gates to a new participation based economy where the value created from financial services are democratically distributed.
