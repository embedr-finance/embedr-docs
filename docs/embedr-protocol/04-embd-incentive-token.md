# EMBD Incentive Token

`EMBD` is the incentive token issued by the EMBEDr Protocol. It captures the fee revenue that is generated by the system - mainly borrowing and redemption fees.

`EMBD` is earned only through providing `rUSD` to the Stability Pool. The more `rUSD` is provided, the more `EMBD` is earned.

## Core Functionality

- [**Staking EMBD**](#staking-embd) - Users can stake their `EMBD` in the staking contract to earn a portion of the fees generated by the system.
- [**Unstaking EMBD**](#unstaking-embd) - Users can unstake their `EMBD` from the staking contract.

### Staking EMBD

Staking EMBD is the process of depositing `EMBD` into the staking contract. Once `EMBD` is staked, the user will start earning a portion of the fees generated by the system.

### Unstaking EMBD

Unstaking EMBD is the process of withdrawing `EMBD` from the staking contract. Once `EMBD` is unstaked, the user will stop earning a portion of the fees generated by the system.

## What is the total supply of EMBD?

The total supply of `EMBD` is XXX.XXX.XXX tokens.

## How to earn a portion of the generated fees?

`rUSD` borrowing and redemption fees are distributed to `EMBD` stakers. Users need to stake their `EMBD` in the staking contract to earn a portion of the fees.

The amount of fees that is distributed to each staker is proportional to the amount of `EMBD` that is staked.
